# Project-Phase-One
#### Business Undestanding

 Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. 
 This analysis aims to explore the type of films that are currently doing best at the box office. As it is assumed films with much more popularity than others are concluded as the films doing well but there is definitely more to it than that hence this analysis. This analysis gained insight from https://filmlifestyle.com/
#### Data Understanding
 The data sources for this analysis will be pulled from several separate files.
tn.movie_budget.csv
Contents: Data about production budget of film creation and their gross profit both worldwide and domestic.
bom.movie_gross.csv
Contents: Data about profits gained from films for all available years from 2010 to 2018
im.db
Contents: Database about the ratings of films by fans of all films 
 Main Objective 
Which films are currently doing best at the box-office?

Specific Objective
- Does the production budget of a film affect the gross profit of the films sales?
- Which genres have the highest number of votes from viewers?
- What is the profitability of films over time?

#### Requirements
In this project there is application of data munging and visualization skills to conduct an exploratory analysis of the datafiles.

1. Load the Dataset with Pandas
Import pandas with the standard alias pd and load the data into a dataframe with the any name suitable.

2. Explore Data Distributions
Produce summary statistics, visualizations, and interpretive text describing the distributions of im.db, tn.movie_budget.csv, and bom.movie_gross.csv.

3. Explore Differences between Subsets
Separate the data into subsets.

4. Explore relations
Find the features that have the most effect on the performance of films created at the bocx-office.

#### Conclusions
Films at the box-office are a continuous landmine of opportunities but some films perform better than others and for one to succeed in this industry it is better to attempt some initiatives to be on the winning end. There are many factors that affect their performance and according to this analysis these are my recommendations:

#### Recommendations
- The company should have a sufficient production budget in order to invest in great film creation projects acquiring the best resources and generate high profits both domestic and worlwide.
- The company should aim to make films in genres that have the highest number of votes which is displayed in this analysis, film genres that are at a higher voters count are definitely doing better than others.
- The company should invest in films that have been profitable over time at the box-office as they end up doing the best at the box-office which is the goal to be achieved.
